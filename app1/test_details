A simple app that loads a pre-trained language model in @app.init and returns some dummy output in @app.handler. This app could help test if the basic functionality of Potassium is working properly.

Test call:
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --request POST \
     --data '{"prompt": "The capital of France is [MASK]."}' \
     http://localhost:8080
